      Bees play a fundamental role in global agriculture by pollinating more
      than 70% of the crops humans rely on for food, including fruits,
      vegetables, nuts, and seeds. Without bees, food production would drop
      significantly, threatening food security and biodiversity. Pollination
      also affects livestock, as many animal feed crops depend on bee activity.
      Protecting bee populations is critical for sustaining life on Earth.

      Water covers approximately 71% of Earth's surface, with oceans accounting
      for about 97% of that water. Oceans regulate the climate, support marine
      biodiversity, and provide resources such as fish and salt. They also
      absorb carbon dioxide, mitigating some effects of climate change, and
      influence weather patterns around the world.

      The human heart pumps around 5 liters of blood per minute while at rest,
      circulating blood through the body to supply oxygen and nutrients to
      tissues. A healthy heart beats roughly 60 to 100 times per minute, and
      maintaining cardiovascular health is crucial to preventing heart disease,
      the leading cause of death globally.

      The ozone layer in Earth's stratosphere absorbs most of the Sun's harmful
      ultraviolet radiation. Its depletion, caused primarily by
      chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), increases the risk of skin cancer and
      cataracts in humans and affects plant and marine ecosystems. International
